<p>Hello, my name is Adrienne Bennett and I am a digital communications designer. In more than 10 years of my design experience, I’ve worked with a wide array of clientele/industry sectors, creating graphics, websites, advertising campaigns, brand identity, and marketing collateral. I’ve participated in two major company re-brand projects and experienced my concepts go from start to finish. While I love all aspects of design, I look forward to expanding my technical skills and shifting my focus from design to development.</p>

<p>I am currently employed as a full time digital communications specialist for a retail 
company in Charlotte, N.C. When I am not working or freelancing, I enjoy running and spending time with my husband and 1 year old son.
